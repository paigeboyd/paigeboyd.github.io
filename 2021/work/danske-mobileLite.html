        <p class="paragraph-3">This project was undertaken whilst I was a Freelance UI/UX Designer for Danske Bank. They hired me to design a solution for elderly or "technophobe" customers, who might be reluctant to use technology for banking.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-3">The deliverable for this project was three high-fidelity user flows to cover the scenarios identified in the research phase. I had 3 days to deliver this project therefore I placed focus on the user research and UI design stages of the process so I could meet the deadline.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">What is Mobile Lite?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-8">Danske Mobile Lite is a stripped back, read-only version of their everyday mobile banking app, created with the aim of reducing customer wait-times in branch by reducing the amount of customers with basic queries that could be answered in the app.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-8">Danske Research showed that a significant amount of their customer assistant's time was spent helping customers in-branch with relatively simple tasks that their Mobile Banking App was supposed to cover. After speaking with customers and the customer assistants, we found that the main issue was a lack of trust in digital products by the aging population of Northern Ireland. Customers stated that they were "afraid of scams", and regarding the regular banking app, "don't know how to use that app... there's too many confusing buttons". They also noted that they were "afraid of doing something wrong" when in the app, as they weren't proficient smartphone or laptop users.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-8">Armed with this user research, I took it a step further and looked at statistics around an aging population and mobile banking, to see if this was an isolated issue. Some key points I found were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="paragraph-8">According to an AgeUK Age-friendly banking study, "thousands of people aged 50+ become victims of financial exploitation every day... the loss of trust and dignity can have severe impacts on their mental health and well-being."</p></li>
            <li><p class="paragraph-8">In a 2019 survey conducted by Channel Analytics, it was revealed that "just 24% of over 65s use mobile banking" in the UK.</p></li>
            <li><p class="paragraph-8">Many elderly people find the internet and technology too difficult to learn, with some believing they're "too old to learn".</p></li>
          </ul>
    
        <p class="paragraph-8">With this in mind, I knew that it was important to create a simplistic solution with only the necessary information and no clutter. Danske's brief stated that they wanted the following information to be available in the app: "Active and Inactive Direct Debits", "Active and Inactive Standing Orders", "Balance and some Recent Transactions" and "Bank Statements". This information from the brief formed the central navigation for the app.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">UI Design</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-8">After conducting user research and drawing the conclusion of how simplistic the app needed to be, I dove straight into designing the app. Sticking to the Danske Bank Brand Guidelines, I used their secondary colour palette which used softer tones to prevent the UI from looking overwhelming, but these allowed me to colour-code each part of the app, meaning users wouldn't lose track and would eventually link the colour with the part of the app they are in.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph-8">Danske had a bank of icons and imagery that could be used in their app, but with permission from the Product Owner, I was able to create my own illustrations to specifically aid this product where needed. I chose to illustrate simple line icons which depcited the four sections of the app; Transactions, Standing Orders, Direct Debits, and Statements.</p>
          
        <p class="paragraph-8">The team and I decided to limit the user's transaction history to only the five most recent transactions, plus any pending transactions. This helped prevent the user from being bombarded with a long list of transactions and kept the information susinct, which would be key with our user base.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">User Flows</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-8">With the UI Designs complete, the final step to achieve the deliverables for this project was to create high-fidelity user flows using these designs, so the Product Owner could present the concept to the stakeholders in a bid to have this project developed as a product for Danske's elderly customers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-text">
        <p class="paragraph-8">Three flows were established during the brief-creation and user research phase which covered avenues in which targeted users would be exposed to the app. The first, was if a customer contacted the banking hotline, and a customer advisor would assist them in downloading the app over the phone.</p>
      </div>
    <img src="danske/images/cust-calls-cd.png" alt="User Flow" width="800"  class="case-study-img">
        <div class="case-study-text">
        <p class="paragraph-8">The second flow covered if a customer advisor assisted the customer with downloading the app in-branch, ideally when they were looking for assistance regarding an issue this app would solve.</p>
      </div>
        <img src="danske/images/cust-inbranch.png" alt="User Flow" width="800"  class="case-study-img">
        <div class="case-study-text">
        <p class="paragraph-8">The final flow was to support marketing promotional material Danske Bank was sending out to target customers. This flow relies on the customer initiating the process themselves. It is possible that some of our target audience will be familiar with how to download an app themselves, or they will have family members or neighbours willing to help them.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">Project Reflection</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-8">This project posed a very specific problem to solve which required a fair bit of research in order for me to fully understand the problem and how I could create a solution. Having grown up in a world surrounded in technology, it was important that I was able to empathise with the elderly to truly understand how they struggled with technology, therefore I found my user research really interesting. Getting to speak to real users and the exact target audience for this product was eye-opening and informed every decision I made in this app.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-8">As this project had such a short timeframe for delivery, I was forced to skip parts of the design process that I usually do, for example wireframes, design experiments and prototype testing. However, it taught me that my process will differ for every project based on its particular demands, so it was important for me to learn to adapt my process to allow me to spend time on the processes that would have the best and most useful outputs.</p>
