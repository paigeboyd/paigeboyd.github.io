        <p class="paragraph-3">A cutting-edge pilot app that revolutionises recycling by rewarding people for doing so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-3">The trial is set to run for 8 weeks in Whitehead, Northern Ireland as a proof of concept with the app intended for release across the UK by the end of 2021. This project is in collaboration with CryptoCycle, Bryson Recycling, and Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. My role in this project was to redesign the UI.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-3">The deliverable for this project is a fully-interactive prototype, ready for development.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-3">Tools used: Adobe XD. </p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">What is Reward4Waste?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-8">Reward4Waste is an app which encourages users to recycle more consistently in order to earn rewards. In collaboration with Spar NI, these points can be exchanged for £2 vouchers to use in Spar, or the points can be donated to various national charities or a local Primary School. </p>
        <p class="paragraph-8">The app not only encourages recycling, but can also help provide key statistics in local areas to provide clarity around recycling and how consumers recycle to better understand consumer behaviour.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-8">The team at CryptoCycle already had a basic app design completed, but we decided that it would be best to redesign the UI to make it look more modern, and in line with what apps generally look like today. In the end, an interactive prototype was delivered to developers to aid their development process.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">UI Design</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-8">The main issues their existing app design had was that it was very low contrast and information wasn't grouped appropriately across the screen. There was a real lack of any visual hierarchy which made the app feel confusing for users. This is where I focused my attention when redesigning the interface. This project had an extremely tight delivery deadline of 1 day for design, therefore it was crucial that I worked quickly, carefully and efficiently.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph-8">To ensure there was a clear visual hierarcy throughout the app, I looked at what content would be most important to the user, and grouped similar pieces of content together. This formed the basis of the Home Screen; allowing users to quickly see their balance and access the rewards screen, providing key statistics as a form of gamification to encourage personal statistics to grow, and providing some rewards as a further form of encouragement.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-8">CryptoCycle's branding made use of shades of green because of it's link to money and recycling, so I carried this throughout the app, creating gradients to add depth to the UI with subtle drop shadows on each card element.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-8">As this is a government backed trial, I'm unable to provide the working prototype, however the app is live in the App Store and Google Play, so pop over and check it out!</p>
         
        <p class="paragraph-8">This project had one of the tightest deadlines I have ever had to meet, so it was a real challenge to make sure I could deliver on time. As a result of this, I had to take the app structure that they had already established in previous designs, and work with it, so if I had have had more time on this project, I would have liked to overhaul the navigation and add more links to the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.</p>
          
        <p class="paragraph-8">The trial for this app is currently running in Whitehead, Northern Ireland and has garnered media attention from BBC, local newspapers and SyncNI. When the trial is over, we will be able to gather key user experience metrics to use in the next iteration of the app, which will be available throughout the UK.</p>
